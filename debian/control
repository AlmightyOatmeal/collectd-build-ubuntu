Description: statistics collection daemon
 collectd is a small daemon written in C for performance. It reads various
 system statistics and updates RRD files, creating them if necessary. Since
 the daemon doesn't need to startup every time it wants to update the files
 it's very fast and easy on the system. Also, the statistics are very fine
 grained since the files are updated every 10 seconds.
 .
